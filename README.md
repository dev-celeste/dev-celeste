# About Me
ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm Maria â€“ a **Junior Software Developer** with a flair for creating apps that donâ€™t just work but *wow*! ðŸŒˆâœ¨

ðŸŽ¨ **UI/UX Enthusiast**: Iâ€™m all about crafting interfaces that are as fun to use as they are beautiful to look at. Design is where creativity meets code, and I love bringing that magic to life.

ðŸ’» **Full Stack Explorer**: Whether it's frontend finesse or backend brilliance, I'm on a mission to make code do cool things on both ends of the spectrum. Full stack development keeps me learning, experimenting, and growing every day!

ðŸŽ“ **Master of Software Engineering @ Penn State**: Currently diving deep into designing and building complex, software-intensive systems. From reusable components to extendable architectures, Iâ€™m learning to make software thatâ€™s as smart as it is scalable.

ðŸŒ± **Community-Driven Developer**: Tech should be a welcoming space for all. Iâ€™m passionate about uplifting marginalized voices and making tech communities more inclusive and accessible.

When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me brainstorming the next big idea, attempting to make a tik tok recipe, or curled up with a good book and my cat (he is orange, send help). Feel free to connect â€“ I love chatting about code, creativity, and the future of tech!
